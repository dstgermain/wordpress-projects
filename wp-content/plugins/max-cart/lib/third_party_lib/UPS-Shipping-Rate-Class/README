This is a very simple class that uses the UPS web service to get a shipping rate. Basically, 
you pass it the shipping method you'd like to use, the destination / shipper zip codes, the 
package dimensions, and receive a shipping quote. There are plenty of values that are hard-coded 
in the XML request that could be passed in dynamically for a more robust rating process.
